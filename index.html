        <p>While the middle class is growing, especially in professional and managerial positions, the working class is shrinking. These changes have significant economic, political, and social impacts. Unions experience fluctuations in membership as they respond to the evolving social structure and labor market.</p>
        <p>This visualization project utilizes the professional class definitions proposed by Oesch to illustrate patterns in migration background, union membership status, professional class, income levels, vote recall, and gender in Germany between 2014 and 2023, using representative samples from the European Social Survey.</p>
        <p>Oesch outlines a detailed 16-class schema for research into labor market stratification or gender segregation. These classes can be collapsed into 8 for topics such as party preferences and political participation and 5 for intergenerational social mobility and inequality. The details can be seen in the tables below.</p>
