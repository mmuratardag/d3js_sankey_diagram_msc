# D3.js Sankey Diagram

Repo hosts Sankey diagrams created using D3.js to visualize descriptive statistics as percentages, accounting for stratification and design weights. Users can toggle between years and filter by migration background, union membership, class, income, vote recall, and gender.

This visualization project utilizes the professional class definitions proposed by Oesch to illustrate patterns in migration background, union membership status, professional class, income levels, vote recall, and gender in Germany between 2014 and 2023, using representative samples from the European Social Survey.
