# D3.js Sankey Diagrams: Occupational Classes in Germany

This repository hosts a series of interactive Sankey diagrams created with D3.js. The visualizations explore the relationships between migration background, trade union membership, professional class, and other socio-economic factors in Germany from 2014 to 2023.

This visualization project utilizes the professional class definitions proposed by Oesch to illustrate patterns in migration background, union membership status, professional class, income levels, vote recall, and gender in Germany between 2014 and 2023, using representative samples from the European Social Survey.

## About The Project
This visualization project utilizes the professional class definitions proposed by Oesch (2022) to illustrate patterns in German society. The charts present descriptive statistics as weighted percentages, accounting for stratification and design weights from the European Social Survey (ESS).

The goal is to provide an intuitive way to explore complex socio-economic data and understand the evolving class structure in Germany.

### Features

## Data Source
The data used in this project is a representative sample for Germany from the European Social Survey (ESS).

The class schemas are based on the work of Daniel Oesch:
